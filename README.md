This is the README.md for Unit 1 homework

In this assignment we were asked to perform code refactoring to be able to clean up as well as add semantic HTML elements. 
The previous code has used div tags for all main elements. I was able to refactor HTML semantic elements while insuring website functionality. 
This document had also been missing an ID tag causing a link in the <nav> bar to no longer function. This has been repaired.
